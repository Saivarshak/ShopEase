# Render Bandwidth Audit and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

Your Render workspace has been suspended because your application has exceeded the **5 GB free bandwidth limit**, currently reaching **8.04 GB**. On Render’s Free tier, all HTTP responses—including HTML, scripts, and media files served through your web service—count toward this quota. 

An audit of your project repository (`Live project Online shoping`) reveals that the primary driver of this high bandwidth consumption is the **unoptimized delivery of large image assets** through a dynamic routing mechanism that explicitly disables browser caching. Each time a visitor loads your homepage or category pages, multiple multi-megabyte images are fetched afresh from your server.

## Key Findings: Why Bandwidth is Spiking

### 1. Oversized Image Assets
Your `static/images/` directory contains numerous high-resolution JPEG and PNG images ranging between **1.8 MB and 3.9 MB each**. For an e-commerce website, these image sizes are excessively large.

| Image File | Size (MB) | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bags.jpg` | 3.89 MB | `static/images/bags.jpg` |
| `watches.jpg` | 2.80 MB | `static/images/watches.jpg` |
| `mens.jpg` | 2.51 MB | `static/images/mens.jpg` |
| `denim-wear.jpg` | 2.26 MB | `static/images/denim-wear.jpg` |
| `party_wear.jpeg` | 2.20 MB | `static/images/party_wear.jpeg` |

*Impact:* When a user visits the homepage or main category pages, they download several of these cards and hero backgrounds simultaneously. Just **250 to 300 full site visits** are enough to exhaust the entire 5 GB monthly bandwidth limit.

### 2. Dynamic Asset Routing Bypasses Caching
Unlike standard Django deployments where static files are served directly via WhiteNoise with aggressive caching headers, your application routes image requests through a custom dynamic view (`store_asset` in `store/views.py`) triggered by the `{% asset_src %}` template tag. 

Furthermore, for database and dynamic media uploads, the view explicitly injects:
```python
response['Cache-Control'] = 'no-store, max-age=0'
```
This forces browsers to **re-download the same images on every single page navigation**, preventing any client-side caching benefits.

### 3. Large Unused Data Files
The repository contains large backup and fixture files in the `data/` directory (such as `store_before_women_gallery_expansion.json` at **3.7 MB**), which add unnecessary bloat.

## Actionable Remediation Steps

To restore your Render service and prevent future bandwidth exhaustion without immediately paying for Pro upgrades, apply the following optimizations:

### Step 1: Compress and Convert Images to WebP
Resize and compress all banner and category images. Convert them to the modern **WebP** format, which typically reduces file sizes by **70–80%** without noticeable loss in visual quality.
- Target size for category cards: **Under 150 KB** (currently 2–4 MB).
- Target size for hero banners: **Under 300 KB**.

### Step 2: Enable Browser Caching for Assets
Update the `store_asset` view in `store/views.py` to allow browser caching instead of forcing `no-store`. Adding a standard cache duration (e.g., `max-age=86400` or higher for static assets) ensures returning visitors do not re-download unchanged images.

### Step 3: Clean Up Unused Repository Bloat
Delete heavy unused JSON backups in the `data/` folder and ensure `.gitignore` excludes local SQLite database files and development logs from deployment.

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Offload Media to Cloud Storage (S3 / Cloudinary):** Move product and category images to an external object storage service or CDN (like Cloudinary or AWS S3). This entirely offloads image bandwidth from your Render web service instance.
2. **Implement Lazy Loading:** Ensure all below-the-fold product and category images use HTML native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`).
